    <h2>Description</h2>

    <p>This grilled pizza recipe uses pizza dough made from scratch topped with mozzarella cheese, sauce, and your choice of savory toppings. Grilled to perfection for a fun outdoor treat.</p>

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>

    <ul>
        <li>3 ½ cups all-purpose flour, or as needed</li>
        <li>1 envelope Fleischmann's® Pizza Crust Yeast</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon sugar</li>
        <li>1 ½ teaspoons salt</li>
        <li>1 ⅓ cups warm water (120 to 130 degrees F/50 degrees C)</li>
        <li>⅓ cup oil</li>
        <li>½ cup pizza sauce, or to taste</li>
        <li>½ cup shredded mozzarella cheese, or to taste</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Steps</h3>

    <ol>
        <li>Start a charcoal fire or preheat a gas grill to medium-high heat.</li>
        <li>Combine 2 cups flour, undissolved yeast, sugar, and salt in a large bowl. Add warm water and 1/3 cup oil; mix until well blended, about 1 minute. Gradually add enough flour to make a soft dough that forms a ball and is slightly sticky. Knead on a floured surface, adding additional flour if necessary, until smooth and elastic but not sticky, about 5 minutes.</li>
        <li>Divide dough into 8 portions. Pat or roll dough on a well-floured counter to about 8-inch circles; they do not need to be perfect.</li>
        <li>Brush both sides of crusts with additional oil. Using hands, lift each crust carefully and place on grill. Cook for 3 to 4 minutes until bottoms are lightly browned and tops look set. Using long handled tongs, remove crusts from grill and place on a baking sheet with grilled-sides facing up.</li>
        <li>Lightly add sauce to the top of each grilled crust, then top with mozzarella cheese.</li>
        <li>Carefully slide pizzas back onto the grill. Cook an additional 3 to 4 minutes until bottom crusts are browned and cheese is melted. Remove from the grill and serve immediately.</li>
    </ol>
